# sway_config
Config files for Sway and various programs

It should be noted that I use Fedora Linux. 
However, I believe this should only matter for some Fish aliases.

List of programs that this configuration is made for:
  - alacritty
  - fish
  - mako
  - mpv
  - neofetch
  - ranger
  - sway
  - swaylock
  - swaybg
  - swayidle
  - waybar
  - wofi

Also, there are other programs that the sway config file utilizes that are not on this list, for example, gammastep and htop.
